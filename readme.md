# Mini-projects
### [as to not clutter my repos]
##### [not that I have many]

*ahem.*

Most of my projects are going to updated sparsely so I might as well not fill my
main repos with them; only my actively-developed projects will have their own repo.
The rest of them will go here :-)

tools are programs that have the possibility to ever be used in any universe
random is for programs that are basically a cut down version of stack overflow but ~~a bit~~ worse.
