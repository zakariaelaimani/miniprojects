# Mini-projects
### [as to not clutter my repos]
##### [not that I have many]

*ahem.*

Most of my projects are going to updated sparsely so I might as well not fill my
main repos with them; only my actively-developed projects will have their own repo.
The rest of them will go here :-)

Projects that require multiple files are in their own folder, otherwise they're put
in the main directory.
